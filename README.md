# UFO Challenge

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to familiarize ourselves with both javascript and html, especially learning how to use javascript within html without breaking anything. This to me was a great activity, as creating a website, albiet a very basic one, is something I've always personally been interested in, but never have had the time/knowledge to do so, until now.

## Results

Using the webpage itself is relatively simple, there are filters for date, city, state, country, and shape. One needs to put in the relevant information, spelled correctly of course, and any relevant results should pop up. 

## Summary

One drawback I see is that there is no auto-populate feature for this, so if someone were spelling something slightly wrong, or simply didn't know one of the filters they needed, this would stop them from completing their search, but if there were an autp-populate feature, this would allow for ease of access. Another recommendation for further development is perhaps a table of options one could access if they weren't sure of every filter of their search.
